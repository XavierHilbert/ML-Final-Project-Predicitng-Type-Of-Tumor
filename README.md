# ML-Final-Project-Predicitng-Type-Of-Tumor
Data used is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data

## Things Accomplished

1. Compared 3 different classification models: Logistic, Decision Tree, and Random Forests. 

2. Found that Decision Tree performed worse and Random Forest performed best on average

3. Identified the most important features in identifying the type of the tumor (reduced number of features needed from 30 to 11 with only a 2% drop in accuracy]: 'radius_mean', 'perimeter_mean', 'area_mean', 'concavity_mean', 'concave points_mean', 'area_se', 'radius_worst', 'perimeter_worst', 'area_worst', 'concavity_worst', and 'concave points_worst'
